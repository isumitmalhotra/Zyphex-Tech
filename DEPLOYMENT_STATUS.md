# 🚀 Deployment Status - VPS Build Timeout Fix

## 📊 Current Status

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Latest Commit:** fe2d2d8 - Build timeout and SSH keep-alive fixes  
**Deployment:** In Progress ⏳  
**GitHub Actions:** https://github.com/isumitmalhotra/Zyphex-Tech/actions

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: ENOMEM (Out of Memory) ✅
- **Problem:** npm install failed with out-of-memory error
- **Solution:** 
  - Optimized npm install with `--prefer-offline --no-audit`
  - Automatic swap file creation
  - Pre-installation cleanup
  - Memory limit: 2048MB
- **Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (npm install now succeeds)

### Issue #2: Build Timeout & SSH Disconnect 🔄
- **Problem:** Build phase fails with "Broken pipe" (SSH timeout)
- **Solution:**
  - SSH keep-alive: ServerAliveInterval=60
  - Background build with nohup (survives disconnection)
  - Build monitoring every 30 seconds
  - Reduced memory: 2048MB (from 4096MB)
  - Disabled ISR memory cache
- **Status:** 🔄 **TESTING** (deployment in progress)

## 🔍 Monitoring the Deployment

### Real-Time Monitoring

**GitHub Actions:**
```
https://github.com/isumitmalhotra/Zyphex-Tech/actions
```

**Quick Status Check (Local):**
```bash
bash scripts/check-deployment.sh
```

**VPS Monitoring:**
```bash
# Watch build progress
ssh user@vps "tail -f /var/www/zyphextech/build.log"

# Monitor system resources
ssh user@vps "watch -n 2 free -h"

# PM2 status
ssh user@vps "pm2 monit"
```

### What to Look For

**✅ Success Indicators:**
- "✅ Dependencies installed successfully"
- "Build running... Xs elapsed" (progress messages)
- "✅ Build completed in Xs"
- "✅ Health check passed!"
- "✅ Deployment successful!"

**❌ Failure Indicators:**
- "client_loop: send disconnect"
- "npm error code ENOMEM"
- "❌ Build failed"
- "❌ Health checks failed"
- "🔄 INITIATING AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK"

---

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Verification

Once deployment completes, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check website is live
curl -I https://www.zyphextech.com

# 2. Check API health
curl https://www.zyphextech.com/api/health

# 3. Check Time Tracking page
curl -I https://www.zyphextech.com/project-manager/time-tracking

# 4. Verify PM2 status
ssh user@vps "pm2 list"

# 5. Check application logs
ssh user@vps "pm2 logs zyphextech --lines 50"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Website: HTTP 200 or 301/302
- API Health: HTTP 200 with JSON response
- Time Tracking: HTTP 200
- PM2: "zyphextech" status "online"
- Logs: No error messages

---

## 🆘 If Deployment Fails Again

### Quick Diagnosis

```bash
# Check build log for errors
ssh user@vps "tail -100 /var/www/zyphextech/build.log"

# Check for OOM kills
ssh user@vps "dmesg | grep -i 'killed process' | tail -20"

# Check available resources
ssh user@vps "free -h && df -h"

# Check swap
ssh user@vps "swapon -s"
```

### Manual Build (Last Resort)

```bash
ssh user@vps
cd /var/www/zyphextech

# Stop PM2 to free memory
pm2 stop zyphextech

# Pull latest
git pull origin main

# Clean and install
npm cache clean --force
NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=2048' npm install --prefer-offline --no-audit --legacy-peer-deps

# Generate Prisma
npx prisma generate

# Build in background
nohup npm run build:vps > build.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor
tail -f build.log

# After build completes
pm2 restart zyphextech
pm2 logs zyphextech
```

### VPS Upgrade (If Needed)

If builds continue to fail:
- **Current:** ~1GB RAM
- **Recommended:** 2GB RAM
- **Cost:** $5-10/month increase

Benefits:
- Faster builds (2-5 min vs 5-10 min)
- More reliable
- Less risk of OOM kills
