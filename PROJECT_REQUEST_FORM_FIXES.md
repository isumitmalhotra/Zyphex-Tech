# Project Request Form Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Form Submission Error
**Problem:** When submitting the project request form from `/user/projects`, it gave an "unexpected error"

**Root Cause:** 
- The form was sending `budget` as a **string** (e.g., "5000", "custom")
- The API expects `budget` as a **number** or `undefined`
- This caused validation to fail with Zod schema

**Solution:**
- Modified `components/user/project-request-form.tsx` to convert budget string to number
- Added proper error handling with detailed error messages
- Handle "custom" budget option by sending `undefined` instead

```typescript
// Before:
body: JSON.stringify(formData)

// After:
const budget = formData.budget && formData.budget !== 'custom' 
  ? parseInt(formData.budget) 
  : undefined

body: JSON.stringify({
  name: formData.name,
  description: formData.description,
  budget, // Now properly typed as number | undefined
  timeline: formData.timeline,
  requirements: formData.requirements
})
```

### 2. ❌ Dashboard Redirect Issue
**Problem:** Clicking "Request New Project" from the main user dashboard (`/user`) redirected to the contact page instead of opening the form modal

**Root Cause:**
- The button was using `<Link href="/contact">` instead of the `ProjectRequestForm` component
- Inconsistent UX between `/user` (redirects to contact) and `/user/projects` (opens modal)

**Solution:**
- Replaced the contact link with the proper `ProjectRequestForm` modal component
- Added the `refetch` callback to reload dashboard data after successful submission
- Now consistent behavior across both pages

```tsx
// Before:
<Button className="zyphex-button-primary" asChild>
  <Link href="/contact">
    <Plus className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    Request New Project
  </Link>
</Button>

// After:
<ProjectRequestForm onSuccess={refetch} />
```

## Where Project Requests Go

When a user submits a project request:

1. **API Endpoint:** `/api/user/projects` (POST)
2. **Database Table:** `Project` in PostgreSQL
3. **Status:** Set to `PLANNING` (pending admin approval)
4. **Client Association:** 
   - Finds or creates a `Client` record based on user email
   - Links the project to this client
5. **User Association:** Links the project to the requesting user
6. **Admin Review:** Admins can see and approve these requests in the admin panel

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **From User Dashboard (`/user`):**
   - Click "Request New Project" button
   - Should open a modal (not redirect to contact)
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Should show success message and refresh dashboard

2. **From My Projects (`/user/projects`):**
   - Click "Request New Project" button
   - Fill out the form with:
     - Project Name (required)
     - Description (required, min 10 chars)
     - Budget (optional - select from dropdown)
     - Timeline (optional)
     - Requirements (optional)
   - Submit and verify success message
   - New project should appear in the list

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Try submitting without required fields → Should show validation errors
   - Try submitting with very short description → Should show "Description must be at least 10 characters"
   - Check console for detailed error messages if submission fails

## Admin View

Admins can view submitted project requests at:
- `/admin/projects` - View all projects including those in PLANNING status
- Filter by status to see pending requests
- Can approve, modify budget, assign team members, etc.

## Database Schema

The project is stored with:
```sql
CREATE TABLE "Project" (
  id          String
  name        String
  description String?
  status      String   (PLANNING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, etc.)
  priority    String   (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
  budget      Float
  hourlyRate  Float
  clientId    String
  createdAt   DateTime
  updatedAt   DateTime
)
```

## Files Modified

1. `components/user/project-request-form.tsx`
   - Fixed budget type conversion
   - Improved error handling
   - Added detailed console logging

2. `app/user/page.tsx`
   - Replaced contact link with ProjectRequestForm modal
   - Added refetch callback for dashboard reload
   - Consistent UX with /user/projects page
