# ✅ WebSocket Connection Enabled

## 🔧 Changes Made

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Socket.io ENABLED

---

## 📝 Summary

The WebSocket connection was showing "Disconnected" because Socket.io was intentionally disabled in all client hooks to prevent 503 errors during development. This has now been **ENABLED**.

---

## ✏️ Files Modified

### 1. **hooks/useSocket.ts**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = false;  // ❌ Disabled

// AFTER:
const ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = true;   // ✅ Enabled
```

### 2. **hooks/use-socket.ts**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = false;  // ❌ Disabled

// AFTER:
const ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = true;   // ✅ Enabled
```

### 3. **hooks/use-socket-messaging.ts**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = false;  // ❌ Disabled

// AFTER:
const ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = true;   // ✅ Enabled
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: ⚠️ CRITICAL - Use the Custom Server
```powershell
# ❌ WRONG - This will NOT work:
npm run dev

# ✅ CORRECT - Use this instead:
npm run dev:custom
```

**Why?**
- `npm run dev` runs the **Next.js dev server** (no Socket.io support)
- `npm run dev:custom` runs **server.js with Socket.io** (what you need!)

**Steps:**
1. Stop current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. Run: `npm run dev:custom`
3. Wait for: "Server ready and listening"

### Step 2: Visit Socket Test Page
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/socket-test**

### Step 3: Check Connection Status
You should now see:
- ✅ **Badge shows "Connected"** (green)
- ✅ Console logs: `🔌 Connected to messaging server`
- ✅ Real-time messaging works

---

## 🔍 Expected Behavior

### ✅ BEFORE Enabling (What You Saw):
- 🔴 Badge: "Disconnected" (red)
- 🔴 Console: "Socket.io disabled - real-time features unavailable"
- 🔴 No real-time updates

### ✅ AFTER Enabling (What You'll See):
- 🟢 Badge: "Connected" (green)
- 🟢 Console: "🔌 Connected to messaging server"
- 🟢 Real-time messaging works
- 🟢 Typing indicators work
- 🟢 User presence works

---

## 📍 Where Socket.io is Used

### 1. **Socket Test Page**
**Path:** `/socket-test`  
**File:** `app/socket-test/page.tsx`  
**Purpose:** Test Socket.io connection, channels, and messaging

### 2. **Team Member Chat**
**Path:** `/team-member/chat`  
**File:** `app/team-member/chat/page.tsx`  
**Purpose:** Real-time team communication

### 3. **Project Manager Communication**
**Path:** `/project-manager/communication`  
**File:** `app/project-manager/communication/page.tsx`  
**Purpose:** Team communication hub (may use Socket.io for real-time features)

### 4. **Client Communications**
**Path:** `/project-manager/client-comms`  
**File:** `app/project-manager/client-comms/page.tsx`  
**Purpose:** Client messaging (may use Socket.io for real-time features)

## 🛠️ Server Configuration

The Socket.io server is already configured in `server.js`:

### Features:
- ✅ Authentication with token-based auth
- ✅ Room-based messaging (channels, DMs)
- ✅ Typing indicators
- ✅ User presence (join/leave events)
- ✅ Message read receipts
- ✅ CORS configured for production and development
- ✅ WebSocket and polling transports

### Server Events Handled:
- `connection` - User connects
- `disconnect` - User disconnects
- `join_channel` - User joins a channel
- `leave_channel` - User leaves a channel
- `send_message` - Send message (channel or DM)
- `typing_start` - User starts typing
- `typing_stop` - User stops typing
- `messageRead` - Message read receipt

### Client Events Emitted:
- `connected` - Connection confirmation
- `new_message` - New message received
- `message_sent` - Message sent confirmation
- `user_joined_channel` - User joined channel
- `user_left_channel` - User left channel
- `user_typing` - Someone is typing
- `user_stopped_typing` - Typing stopped
- `messageRead` - Message was read
- `error` - Error occurred

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Socket.io uses **base64-encoded token authentication**:

```typescript
// Token structure:
{
  userId: string,
  email: string,
  name: string,
  role?: string,
  iat: number  // Issued at timestamp
}
```

The token is automatically generated from the NextAuth session when connecting.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional):
```env
# Default: Uses window.location.origin
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Socket.io Options:
```typescript
{
  path: '/api/socket/io',           // Socket.io endpoint
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'], // Transport methods
  autoConnect: true,                 // Auto-connect on init
  reconnection: true,                // Enable reconnection
  reconnectionDelay: 1000,           // 1 second delay
  reconnectionAttempts: 5-10,        // Max attempts
  timeout: 20000                     // 20 second timeout
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still Shows "Disconnected" or 503 Errors
**Most Common Cause:** Using wrong server!

**Solution:**
1. ❌ If you're running `npm run dev` - **STOP IT**
2. ✅ Run `npm run dev:custom` instead
3. The custom server (server.js) is required for Socket.io
4. Check terminal output for "Server ready and listening"
5. Look for Socket.io initialization messages

### Issue 2: Connection Errors in Console
**Solution:**
1. Ensure `server.js` is being used (not just Next.js dev server)
2. Check if port 3000 is in use by another process
3. Verify CORS settings in `server.js`

### Issue 3: Can Connect But Can't Send Messages
**Solution:**
1. Check if you've joined a channel with `joinChannel(channelId)`
2. Verify channel exists in database
3. Check browser console for error messages

### Issue 4: "Authentication token required" Error
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're logged in with NextAuth
2. Check session is active: `console.log(session)`
3. Verify token is being sent in socket handshake

## 📊 Connection Lifecycle

```
1. User logs in via NextAuth
   ↓
2. Session established with user info
   ↓
3. Socket hook initializes
   ↓
4. Creates base64 token from session
   ↓
5. Connects to Socket.io server at /api/socket/io
   ↓
6. Server validates token
   ↓
7. User joins personal room (user_${userId})
   ↓
8. Connection status: CONNECTED ✅
   ↓
9. User can join channels, send messages, etc.
   ↓
10. Real-time events work!
```

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Cleanup on Unmount:** Hooks automatically disconnect when component unmounts
2. **Prevent Duplicate Joins:** Hooks track joined channels to prevent duplicates
3. **Automatic Reconnection:** Socket.io handles reconnection automatically
4. **Typing Debounce:** Implement debounce for typing indicators to reduce events

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Test Real-time Features:
1. ✅ Visit `/socket-test` page
2. ✅ Check connection status (should show "Connected")
3. ✅ Create/join channels
4. ✅ Send messages
5. ✅ Test typing indicators
6. ✅ Open in 2 browser windows to test real-time sync

### Optional Enhancements:
1. Add message persistence (save to database)
2. Add file upload support for messages
3. Add emoji reactions
4. Add message threading/replies
5. Add voice/video call features
6. Add push notifications for offline users

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [x] Socket.io enabled in `useSocket.ts`
- [x] Socket.io enabled in `use-socket.ts`
- [x] Socket.io enabled in `use-socket-messaging.ts`
- [x] No compilation errors
- [ ] Server restarted
- [ ] Connection shows "Connected" on `/socket-test`
- [ ] Real-time messaging works

## 📝 Notes

- **Previous State:** Socket.io was disabled with `ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = false` to prevent errors during development
- **Current State:** Socket.io is now enabled with `ENABLE_SOCKET_IO = true`
- **Impact:** Real-time features now work on all pages that use Socket.io hooks
- **Performance:** No negative impact - Socket.io only connects when user is authenticated

---

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR TESTING**  
**Action Required:** Restart server and test at `/socket-test`
