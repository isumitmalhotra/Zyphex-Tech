## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Badge Shows "0" but I know there are messages
**Fix**:
1. Check `/super-admin/notifications` page directly
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R
3. Badge updates every 30 seconds automatically

### Notification doesn't navigate
**Check**:
1. Is there an `actionUrl` in the notification?
2. For messages, URL should be: `/super-admin/messages-new?id=...`
3. Check browser console for errors

### Can't send reply
**Check**:
1. Is reply text entered?
2. Check if logged in as admin
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Verify recipient exists

### Messages page shows "Loading..."
**Fix**:
1. Check API: `http://localhost:3000/api/super-admin/messages`
2. Verify admin access (ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN role)
3. Check database connection
