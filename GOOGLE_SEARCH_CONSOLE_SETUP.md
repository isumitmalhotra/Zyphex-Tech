### Option B: If DigiYantra Manages DNS

If you don't have direct access to DNS settings, contact DigiYantra Digital:

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: Add DNS TXT Record for Google Search Console

Hi DigiYantra Team,

I need to verify my domain zyphextech.com with Google Search Console.

Please add the following TXT record to my domain's DNS:

Record Type: TXT
Host/Name: @ (root domain)
Value: google-site-verification=-Mr8Jg-0A0YamK4NGN4cnYNZ9s2uFaHqy6VpbdAs3_U
TTL: 600 (or default)

This is for Google Search Console verification and will help with SEO.

Thank you!

## Step 3: Verify DNS Record Was Added

Wait 5-10 minutes after adding, then test:

### Method 1: Online Tool
Go to: https://mxtoolbox.com/TXTLookup.aspx  
Enter: `zyphextech.com`  
Click: **TXT Lookup**

Should show: `google-site-verification=-Mr8Jg-0A0YamK4NGN4cnYNZ9s2uFaHqy6VpbdAs3_U`

### Method 2: Command Line (Windows PowerShell)
```powershell
nslookup -type=TXT zyphextech.com
```

### Method 3: Online DNS Checker

Should show the TXT record propagating globally.

## Step 4: Verify in Google Search Console

1. Go back to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. On the verification page, click **VERIFY** button
3. If successful: ✅ You'll see "Ownership verified" message
4. If failed: Wait another hour and try again (DNS can take up to 48 hours)

---

## Step 5: Submit Sitemap

After verification is successful:

1. In Google Search Console, click on your property
2. Go to **Sitemaps** in the left menu
3. Enter: `https://zyphextech.com/sitemap.xml`
4. Click **Submit**
5. Status should show: "Success" (might take a few minutes)

---

## Step 6: Request Indexing

1. Go to **URL Inspection** in the left menu
2. Enter: `https://zyphextech.com`
3. Click **TEST LIVE URL**
4. If crawlable, click **REQUEST INDEXING**
5. Repeat for important pages:
   - `https://zyphextech.com/services`
   - `https://zyphextech.com/about`
   - `https://zyphextech.com/portfolio`
   - `https://zyphextech.com/contact`

## Step 7: Remove Old Cached Results (Optional)

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ "Could not verify ownership"

**Possible Causes:**
1. DNS record not added yet
2. DNS not propagated (wait 24-48 hours)
3. Typo in the verification code
4. Wrong host/name field

**Solutions:**
```powershell
# Check if record exists
nslookup -type=TXT zyphextech.com

# Check globally
# Visit: https://www.whatsmydns.net/#TXT/zyphextech.com
```

If no record found:
- Double-check you added it correctly
- Try adding with hostname "zyphextech.com" instead of "@"
- Contact domain provider support

### ❌ "DNS record not found"

Wait longer. DNS changes can take:
- 5-10 minutes (best case)
- 1-4 hours (typical)
- Up to 48 hours (worst case)

### ❌ Multiple TXT records showing

That's fine! You can have multiple TXT records. Just make sure the Google one is there.

## Alternative Verification Methods

If DNS verification doesn't work, try these:

### Method 1: HTML Meta Tag (Already Set Up!)

I already added this to your code, so you can use this instead:

1. In Search Console, choose "HTML tag" method
2. It will show a code like: `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="..." />`
3. Update `app/layout.tsx` with the code (I can do this for you)
4. Deploy and verify

### Method 2: HTML File Upload

1. Search Console will give you a file like `googleXXXXXX.html`
2. Upload to: `public/googleXXXXXX.html`
3. Deploy
4. Verify

### Method 3: Google Analytics

If you add Google Analytics, you can verify through that.
