---

## 📋 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Access Google Search Console

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Add Property"** or **"Start Now"**

---

### Step 2: Add Your Property

You'll see two options:

#### **Option A: Domain Property** (Recommended)
- Verifies all subdomains and protocols (http/https/www/non-www)
- URL: `zyphextech.com`
- Requires DNS verification

#### **Option B: URL Prefix**
- Verifies only the exact URL
- URL: `https://www.zyphextech.com` OR `https://zyphextech.com`
- Multiple verification methods

**Choose Option A (Domain)** for complete coverage.

---

### Step 3: Verify Ownership

Google offers multiple verification methods. Choose the one that works best for you:

---

## 🔐 Verification Method 1: HTML Meta Tag (Easiest)

### What You'll Get:
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE" />
```

### Steps:

1. **In Google Search Console:**
   - Select "HTML tag" verification method
   - Copy the verification code (looks like: `abc123xyz456...`)

2. **I'll add it to your layout.tsx file:**

Replace line 91 in `app/layout.tsx`:
```typescript
verification: {
  google: "your-google-verification-code", // ← Replace with your actual code
},
```

With:
```typescript
verification: {
  google: "abc123xyz456...", // ← Your actual verification code
},
```

3. **Deploy to production**
4. **Click "Verify" in Search Console**

---

## 🔐 Verification Method 2: HTML File Upload

### What You'll Get:
A file like `google1234567890abcdef.html`

### Steps:

1. **Download the HTML file from Search Console**

2. **Add to your public folder:**
   - Save file to: `c:\Projects\Zyphex-Tech\public\google1234567890abcdef.html`
   - The file just needs to exist (content doesn't matter)

3. **Deploy to production**

4. **Verify:** File should be accessible at `https://www.zyphextech.com/google1234567890abcdef.html`

5. **Click "Verify" in Search Console**

---

## 🔐 Verification Method 3: Google Analytics (If GA4 is connected)

If you're using the same Google account for GA4 and Search Console:

1. In Search Console verification, select **"Google Analytics"**
2. Click **"Verify"**
3. Done! ✅

**Note:** This only works if:
- Your GA4 tracking is already live on production
- You're using the same Google account for both

---

## 🔐 Verification Method 4: DNS Verification (For Domain Property)

### Steps:

1. **In Search Console:**
   - Select "DNS record" verification
   - Copy the TXT record (looks like: `google-site-verification=abc123...`)

2. **Add to your domain DNS settings:**
   - Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
   - Add a new **TXT record**:
     - **Type:** TXT
     - **Name/Host:** @ (or leave blank)
     - **Value:** `google-site-verification=abc123...`
     - **TTL:** 3600 (or default)

3. **Wait 10-60 minutes** for DNS propagation

4. **Click "Verify" in Search Console**

---

## 📊 After Verification - Initial Setup

### 1. Add All Property Versions

Add both:
- `https://www.zyphextech.com` (with www)
- `https://zyphextech.com` (without www)

This ensures all traffic is tracked.

### 2. Submit Your Sitemap

Your Next.js app has a sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`:

1. In Search Console, go to **Sitemaps** (left sidebar)
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**

Google will now crawl and index your pages faster!

### 3. Set Preferred Domain (if using URL Prefix)

1. Go to **Settings** > **Site Settings**
2. Set your preferred domain (with or without www)
3. Set up 301 redirects to your preferred version

---

## 🚀 What to Do After Setup

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Submit Sitemap** (as above)
2. **Request Indexing** for your homepage:
   - Go to URL Inspection
   - Enter: `https://www.zyphextech.com`
   - Click "Request Indexing"

3. **Check Coverage:**
   - Go to "Coverage" report
   - See if Google can crawl your pages
   - Fix any errors

4. **Enable Email Notifications:**
   - Settings > Users and Permissions
   - Add your email for critical alerts

### Regular Monitoring (Weekly):

- 📈 **Performance Report:** Track clicks, impressions, CTR, position
- 🔍 **Coverage Report:** Monitor indexed pages
- 📱 **Mobile Usability:** Fix mobile issues
- 🔗 **Links Report:** See who's linking to you
- ⚡ **Core Web Vitals:** Monitor page speed

---

## 🎨 Optional: Create Sitemap (Already Done!)

Your app already has `/app/sitemap.ts`, which generates:
```
https://www.zyphextech.com/sitemap.xml
```

To verify it works:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
3. Should see XML with all your pages

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Verification Failed"

**Meta Tag:**
- Ensure code is in `<head>` section (it is in layout.tsx)
- Deploy to production before verifying
- Wait 2-3 minutes after deployment

**HTML File:**
- File must be in `public/` folder
- Must be accessible at root URL
- Check file name matches exactly

**DNS:**
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Use [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) to verify
- Ensure no typos in TXT record

### "Data Not Appearing"

- It takes **24-48 hours** for data to appear
- Google needs to crawl your site first
- Submit sitemap to speed up indexing

### "Coverage Errors"

Common fixes:
- Check `robots.txt` isn't blocking pages
- Ensure pages have proper meta tags
- Fix any broken links
- Improve page load speed
