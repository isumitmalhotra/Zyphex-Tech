## üõ°Ô∏è RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Risk:
1. **Payment Integration** - Incomplete Stripe flow
   - Mitigation: Dedicate 3 days for thorough testing
   - Backup: Have manual payment option ready

2. **Email Delivery** - Untested SMTP configuration
   - Mitigation: Test with multiple providers
   - Backup: Use email service API (SendGrid/Mailgun)

3. **Stub Pages** - 13 pages without functionality
   - Mitigation: Implement priority pages first
   - Backup: Hide incomplete pages behind feature flags

### Medium Risk:
1. **Performance** - Untested under load
   - Mitigation: Load testing before launch
   - Backup: Have scaling plan ready

2. **Real-time Features** - Socket.IO stress test needed
   - Mitigation: Test with 100+ concurrent users
   - Backup: Fallback to polling

### Low Risk:
1. **Documentation** - Can be completed post-launch
2. **CMS Features** - Not critical for initial launch
3. **Analytics** - Can use simplified version initially
