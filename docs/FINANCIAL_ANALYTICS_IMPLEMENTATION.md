- **Export Options**: CSV and PDF report generation
- **Filtering**: Timeframe (3m, 6m, 12m, YTD) and project selection

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Project Profitability Analysis**: Complete with cost breakdown and time tracking
✅ **Client Lifetime Value**: Complete with retention and risk scoring
✅ **Revenue Forecasting**: Complete with pipeline integration and confidence scoring
✅ **Cash Flow Projections**: Complete with burn rate and runway calculations
✅ **Expense Tracking**: Complete with categorization and reimbursement tracking
⚠️ **QuickBooks/Xero Integration**: Planned but not yet implemented

2. Select timeframe (3m, 6m, 12m, YTD)
3. Filter by specific project if needed
4. Explore different tabs for detailed insights
5. Export reports as CSV or PDF

### API Usage
```typescript
// Get project profitability
const response = await fetch('/api/analytics/financial?projectId=proj-123');

// Bulk analysis
const response = await fetch('/api/analytics/financial', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'revenue_forecast',
    timeframe: 12
  })
});
```
