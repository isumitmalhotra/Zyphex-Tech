# Dashboard Database Field Fixes - Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. `assigneeId` Field Error in Project Queries
**Error**: `Unknown argument 'assigneeId'. Available options are marked with ?`

**Root Cause**: The team-member dashboard API was trying to query projects with `assigneeId` field, but the Project model doesn't have this field.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (INCORRECT):
{ assigneeId: userId }

// After (CORRECT):
{ users: { some: { id: userId } } }
```

### 2. `startTime` Field Error in TimeEntry Queries
**Error**: Previous fix needed for TimeEntry field mapping

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (INCORRECT):
startTime: { gte: sevenDaysAgo }

// After (CORRECT):
date: { gte: sevenDaysAgo }
```

### 3. `duration` Field Error in TimeEntry Processing
**Error**: TimeEntry model uses `hours` not `duration`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (INCORRECT):
entry.duration || 0

// After (CORRECT):
parseFloat(entry.hours || '0')
```

### 4. Document Project Relationship Queries
**Fix Applied**: Updated document queries to use correct project relationship structure.

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/team-member/dashboard/route.ts`
   - Fixed Project queries to use correct relationship fields
   - Fixed TimeEntry field mappings (startTime â†’ date, duration â†’ hours)
   - Fixed Document project relationship queries
   - Updated TypeScript typing for better error prevention

## Testing Instructions

1. **Login as Team Member**:
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/login`
   - Use credentials: `dev.alice@zyphextech.com` / `password123`

2. **Access Team Member Dashboard**:
   - After login, navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/team-member`
   - Dashboard should load without database field errors

3. **Verify API Endpoint**:
   - The `/api/team-member/dashboard` endpoint should now work without errors
   - Should return comprehensive dashboard data with task stats, project info, time tracking, etc.

## Expected Behavior

âœ… **Dashboard loads successfully**
âœ… **No more "Unknown argument" database errors**
âœ… **All sidebar navigation works (Tasks, Projects, Time Tracking, Team Chat)**
âœ… **Dashboard cards show data (even if mock data initially)**
âœ… **API returns 200 status with proper JSON response**

## Current Status

- âœ… All database field mapping errors resolved
- âœ… Project relationship queries fixed
- âœ… TimeEntry field references corrected
- âœ… TypeScript errors addressed
- âœ… Development server running on localhost:3001
- ðŸ”„ Ready for user testing

## Next Steps

1. Test the team member dashboard functionality
2. Verify all sidebar pages work correctly
3. If successful, similar fixes may be needed for other role dashboards (Client, Project Manager, Super Admin)
4. Consider implementing real data seeding for more realistic testing

## Notes

- The team member dashboard is accessible at `/team-member` not `/dashboard/team-member`
- All pages (Tasks, Projects, Time Tracking, Team Chat) have been fully implemented
- Mock data is currently used but the structure supports real database integration
- The API now correctly uses Prisma schema field names and relationships
