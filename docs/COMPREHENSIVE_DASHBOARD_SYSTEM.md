## Technical Implementation

### 1. API Routes Structure
```
/api/
├── super-admin/dashboard/route.ts
├── project-manager/dashboard/route.ts
├── team-member/dashboard/route.ts
├── client/dashboard/route.ts
├── admin/dashboard/route.ts (existing)
└── user/dashboard/route.ts (existing)
```

### 2. Dashboard Hooks
```
/hooks/
├── use-super-admin-dashboard.ts
├── use-project-manager-dashboard.ts
├── use-team-member-dashboard.ts
├── use-client-dashboard.ts
├── use-admin-dashboard.ts (existing)
└── use-user-dashboard.ts (existing)
```

### 3. Page Components
```
/app/
├── super-admin/page.tsx + layout.tsx
├── project-manager/page.tsx + layout.tsx
├── team-member/page.tsx + layout.tsx
├── client/page.tsx + layout.tsx
├── admin/page.tsx (existing)
└── user/page.tsx (existing)
```

### 4. Smart Routing System
The main dashboard (`/dashboard`) automatically redirects users to their role-specific dashboard:
- `SUPER_ADMIN` → `/super-admin`
- `ADMIN` → `/admin`
- `PROJECT_MANAGER` → `/project-manager`
- `TEAM_MEMBER` → `/team-member`
- `CLIENT` → `/client`
- `USER` → `/user`

### 5. Middleware Protection
Updated middleware protects all new routes with appropriate role-based access:
```typescript
const protectedRoutes = [
  { path: '/super-admin', roles: ['SUPER_ADMIN'] },
  { path: '/admin', roles: ['SUPER_ADMIN', 'ADMIN'] },
  { path: '/project-manager', roles: ['SUPER_ADMIN', 'ADMIN', 'PROJECT_MANAGER'] },
  { path: '/team-member', roles: ['SUPER_ADMIN', 'ADMIN', 'PROJECT_MANAGER', 'TEAM_MEMBER'] },
  { path: '/client', roles: ['SUPER_ADMIN', 'ADMIN', 'CLIENT'] },
  // ... API routes with corresponding permissions
]
```

### 6. Permission Guards
Each dashboard is protected with `PermissionGuard` components that check:
- Authentication status
- Required permissions for the role
- Fallback UI for unauthorized access

## Database Integration

### Enhanced Queries by Role

#### Super Admin
- System-wide statistics and analytics
- User management and security metrics
- Cross-project performance analysis
- Audit log monitoring

#### Project Manager
- Project-specific team performance
- Resource allocation and planning
- Task management across projects
- Team communication tracking

#### Team Member
- Personal task and time tracking
- Project involvement and contributions
- Individual performance metrics
- Personal document access

#### Client
- Client-specific project visibility
- Financial transaction history
- Communication logs with team
- Document sharing and access

## Security Features

### 1. Permission-Based Access

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Data Fetching
- SWR for efficient data caching and revalidation
- Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### 2. Query Optimization
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Data aggregation at the database level
- Minimal data transfer with selective field inclusion

### 3. Component Optimization
- Lazy loading for dashboard components
- Memoized expensive calculations
- Efficient re-rendering strategies

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Environment Variables
Required environment variables for full functionality:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key
NEXTAUTH_URL=your-domain.com
```

### 2. Database Migrations
- All required models are in place
- Additional indexes may be needed for performance
- Consider connection pooling for production

### 3. Monitoring
- Dashboard performance monitoring
- API response time tracking
- Error logging and alerting

## Usage Instructions

Each role has access to relevant information and functionality while maintaining strict security boundaries. The system is scalable, maintainable, and provides excellent user experience across all user types.

The implementation leverages the existing RBAC system and extends it with role-specific dashboards that provide meaningful insights and functionality for each user type in the organization.
