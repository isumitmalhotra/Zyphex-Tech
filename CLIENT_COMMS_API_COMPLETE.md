## üîß CLIENT UPDATES

### Updated: app/project-manager/client-comms/page.tsx

**Socket.io Connection:**
- Updated to use correct path: `/api/socket/io`
- Added authentication with Base64 token
- Auto-joins user's personal room on connect
- Properly handles typing indicators with userId
- Includes session dependency in useEffect

**File Upload:**
- Changed from blob URLs to actual server upload
- Uploads files via `/api/project-manager/client-comms/upload`
- Shows upload progress
- Displays success/error toasts
- Properly integrates uploaded files with messages

---

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE SCHEMA

The implementation uses the existing Prisma schema:

### Message Model (Used for All Communications)
```prisma
model Message {
  id          String      @id @default(uuid())
  senderId    String
  receiverId  String?
  subject     String?     // Used to differentiate emails
  content     String
  messageType MessageType @default(DIRECT)
  readAt      DateTime?   // Used for read receipts
  attachments String?     // JSON array of file metadata
  createdAt   DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime    @updatedAt
  
  sender    User @relation("MessageSender")
  receiver  User? @relation("MessageReceiver")
}
```

**Usage:**
- Regular messages: No subject
- Emails: Has subject field
- Meetings: messageType=SYSTEM, metadata in attachments
- Calls: messageType=SYSTEM, metadata in attachments
- Read status: readAt field (null = unread, timestamp = read)

- Files stored with timestamp prefix (prevents overwriting)
- Validates file presence before processing

### API Security
- Session validation on every request
- Client ID validation
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Prevents unauthorized access to other users' data

---

## üìù ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` - Socket.io server URL (optional, defaults to localhost:3000)

---

## üéØ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Database Queries
- Indexed queries on senderId, receiverId, readAt
- Efficient unread count queries
- Optimized message fetching with filters
- Limited project information (take: 1)

### Socket.io

- Efficient event broadcasting
- Connection pooling
- Auto-reconnection support

### File Upload

## üêõ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **File Storage**: Files stored locally in `public/uploads/` (consider cloud storage for production)
2. **File Size**: 10MB limit per file (can be increased if needed)
3. **Meeting/Call Stats**: Currently return 0 (need to parse system messages for accurate counts)
4. **Pagination**: Messages not paginated (will be slow with thousands of messages)
5. **Search**: No search functionality within conversations yet

---

## üîÆ FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

1. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate AWS S3 or similar for file uploads
2. **Message Pagination**: Load messages in chunks for better performance
3. **Search**: Full-text search within conversations
4. **Voice Messages**: Add audio recording and playback
5. **Video Calls**: Integrate WebRTC for video conferencing
6. **Message Editing**: Allow users to edit sent messages
7. **Message Reactions**: Add emoji reactions to messages
8. **Online Status**: Show which clients are currently online
9. **Delivery Receipts**: Show when message is delivered (before read)
10. **Message Threading**: Reply to specific messages
