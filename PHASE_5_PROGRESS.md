## 📝 Notes

- **Responsive pages list**: Successfully integrated ResponsiveTable with full CRUD operations, mobile-first design, and touch-friendly controls.
- **Test-ID strategy**: Using descriptive names like `{page}-{component}-{element}` (e.g., `users-search-input`).
- **Lint-free code**: All integrated files have zero lint errors.
- **Backup files**: Original implementations backed up with `.backup` extension.
