## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Page shows "Unauthorized"
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in. Go to `/login` first.

### Issue: No clients appear
**Solution**: 
1. Check database connection
2. Try creating a new client
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify API routes are accessible

### Issue: Search doesn't work
**Solution**: Wait a moment after typing. Search is debounced (updates on useEffect).

### Issue: Modal doesn't close
**Solution**: Click the X button or click outside the modal.

### Issue: CSV export doesn't work
**Solution**: Check browser's download settings. File should auto-download.

### Issue: Stats show 0

### Issue: Projects don't appear
**Solution**: Make sure project was created successfully. Check toast notification.

## 🎓 Developer Testing

### API Testing with cURL

#### Get all clients
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/project-manager/clients \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

#### Create client
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/project-manager/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Client",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "company": "Test Co",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "address": "123 Test St"
  }'
```

#### Get client details
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/project-manager/clients/CLIENT_ID \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

#### Get stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/project-manager/clients/stats \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

### Database Queries

Check clients in database:
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, company, "createdAt" 
FROM "Client" 
WHERE "deletedAt" IS NULL 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

Check projects for client:
```sql
SELECT id, name, status, budget, "budgetUsed", "completionRate"
FROM "Project" 
WHERE "clientId" = 'CLIENT_ID' 
AND "deletedAt" IS NULL;
```
