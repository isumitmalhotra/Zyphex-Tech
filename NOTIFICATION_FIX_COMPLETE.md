# ✅ NOTIFICATION ROUTING FIX - COMPLETE

## Issue Fixed
When clicking on notifications in the super-admin dashboard, users were being redirected to `/user/messages` instead of `/super-admin/messages`. This caused the wrong dashboard style to load.

## Root Cause
Notification `actionUrl` was hardcoded to `/user/messages` regardless of the recipient's role.

## Solution Implemented
Updated notification creation to use **role-based dynamic routing**:

### Files Modified

#### 1. ✅ `app/api/super-admin/messages/route.ts`
**What changed:**
- Added role detection when fetching recipient
- Dynamic routing based on recipient's role
- Routes to correct dashboard for each user type

**Before:**
```typescript
actionUrl: `/user/messages?id=${message.id}` // Always user dashboard
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Check recipient role
const recipient = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { id: recipientId },
  select: { id: true, role: true }
})

// Route based on role
switch (recipient.role) {
  case 'SUPER_ADMIN':
    messagesRoute = '/super-admin/messages'
    break
  case 'ADMIN':
    messagesRoute = '/admin/messages'
    break
  // ... etc for all roles
}

actionUrl: `${messagesRoute}?id=${message.id}` // Correct dashboard!
```

#### 2. ✅ `app/api/messaging/messages/route.ts`
**What changed:**
- Added `role` to channel members query
- Dynamic routing for each member based on their role
- Fixed TypeScript type with `as const`

**Before:**
```typescript
members: {
  select: {
    id: true  // No role!
  }
}
// ...
actionUrl: `/messages?channel=${channelId}` // Generic route
```

**After:**
```typescript
members: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    role: true  // Added role!
  }
}
// ...
// Route each member to their correct dashboard
switch (member.role) {
  case 'SUPER_ADMIN':
    messagesRoute = '/super-admin/messages'
    break
  // ... etc
}
```

## Routing Matrix

| User Role | Notification Redirects To |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | `/super-admin/messages` ✅ |
| ADMIN | `/admin/messages` ✅ |
| PROJECT_MANAGER | `/project-manager/messages` ✅ |
| TEAM_MEMBER | `/team-member/messages` ✅ |
| CLIENT | `/client/messages` ✅ |
| USER | `/user/messages` ✅ |

## Clear Old Notifications (Optional)

If you still see old notifications with incorrect routes:

**Option 1: Delete all message notifications** (they'll regenerate correctly)
```sql
DELETE FROM "Notification" WHERE type = 'MESSAGE';
```

**Option 2: Clear notifications for specific user**
```sql
DELETE FROM "Notification" 
WHERE "userId" = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
AND type = 'MESSAGE';
```

**Option 3: Clear all notifications** (nuclear option)
```sql
DELETE FROM "Notification";
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

3. **Test as Super Admin:**
   - Login as super-admin
   - Send yourself a message or have someone message you
   - Go to notifications
   - Click the message notification
   - **Expected:** Opens `/super-admin/messages` ✅
   - **Before:** Opened `/user/messages` ❌

4. **Test other roles:**
   - Repeat for admin, PM, team member, client, user
   - Each should open their own dashboard messages page

## How It Works

### When a notification is created:
1. System checks the **recipient's role** from the database
2. Uses a **switch statement** to determine correct route
3. Sets `actionUrl` to the **role-specific messages page**
4. When user clicks notification → routes to **correct dashboard**

### Example Flow:
```
1. Admin sends message to Super Admin
2. System checks: Super Admin role = "SUPER_ADMIN"
3. Creates notification with actionUrl = "/super-admin/messages?id=123"
4. Super Admin clicks notification
5. Opens Super Admin dashboard messages page ✅
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - All notification routes now dynamic based on user role  
✅ **TESTED** - TypeScript compilation successful  
✅ **READY** - Deploy and test in browser  

## Quick Test

Run this in browser console after logging in as super-admin:

```javascript
// Check your notifications API
fetch('/api/super-admin/notifications')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log('Notifications:', data.notifications)
    // Check actionUrl for each notification
    data.notifications.forEach(n => {
      console.log(`Type: ${n.type}, Route: ${n.actionUrl}`)
    })
  })
```

**Expected:** All MESSAGE notifications should have `/super-admin/messages` in the actionUrl.
