# 🎯 PM2 Status Check - Critical Step

## Current Situation

PM2 shows `online` status (✅) but logs show old errors. This is normal - those are cached logs from previous crashes.

## ✅ Verify Server is Actually Running

Run these commands to confirm the server started successfully:

```bash
# Wait 5 seconds for server to fully start
sleep 5

# Check FRESH logs (flush old ones)
pm2 flush zyphextech

# Check current logs
pm2 logs zyphextech --lines 20

# Check if server is listening on port 3000
netstat -tlnp | grep 3000

# Check PM2 detailed status
pm2 show zyphextech
```

## 🌐 Test the Website Now

Open your browser and visit:
```
https://zyphextech.com
```

**If the site loads:**
✅ Success! The server is running despite the old error logs

**If the site still shows errors:**
The server might be starting but crashing. Continue below.

## 🔍 Alternative: Check Real-Time Logs

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time (press Ctrl+C to stop)
pm2 logs zyphextech

# Or check server process directly
ps aux | grep node

# Or check if port 3000 is in use
lsof -i :3000
```

## 🚨 If Server is Actually Crashing

The error logs show it's looking for `.next/prerender-manifest.json` but we confirmed it exists. This could be:

1. **Permissions issue** - server can't read the file
2. **Path issue** - server is looking in wrong directory
3. **PM2 working directory** - PM2 not starting from correct folder

### Fix: Delete PM2 App and Start Fresh

```bash
# Stop and delete completely
pm2 delete zyphextech

# Start with explicit working directory
cd /var/www/zyphextech
pm2 start npm --name "zyphextech" -- start --cwd /var/www/zyphextech

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# Check logs
pm2 logs zyphextech
```

---

## 📊 Check PM2 Configuration

```bash
# View current PM2 config
pm2 show zyphextech

# Check PM2 startup script
pm2 startup

# View saved PM2 ecosystem
cat ~/.pm2/dump.pm2
```
