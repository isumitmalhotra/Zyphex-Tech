## 🔍 Penetration Testing Guide

### 1. OWASP ZAP Integration

#### Setup
```bash
# Install OWASP ZAP
# Download from: https://www.zaproxy.org/download/

# Or use Docker
docker pull zaproxy/zap-stable
docker run -u zap -p 8080:8080 -p 8090:8090 -i zaproxy/zap-stable zap-webswing.sh
```

#### Automated Scan
```bash
# Baseline scan (passive)
docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t zaproxy/zap-stable zap-baseline.py \
  -t http://localhost:3000 \
  -r zap-report.html

# Full scan (active)
docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t zaproxy/zap-stable zap-full-scan.py \
  -t http://localhost:3000 \
  -r zap-full-report.html
```

#### Areas to Test
1. **Authentication**
   - Login bypass attempts
   - Session hijacking
   - Token manipulation
   - Password reset vulnerabilities

2. **File Upload**
   - Malicious file upload (executables)
   - MIME type spoofing
   - Directory traversal
   - File size bypass

3. **API Endpoints**
   - SQL injection
   - XSS attacks
   - CSRF attacks
   - Unauthorized access

4. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypted data exposure
   - Key management
   - Decryption attacks

### 2. Manual Penetration Testing

#### Test Case 1: File Upload Bypass
```bash
# Attempt 1: Upload executable with double extension
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@malicious.pdf.exe"

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - Extension blocked

# Attempt 2: MIME type spoofing
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@executable.exe;type=application/pdf"

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - Magic number mismatch

# Attempt 3: Directory traversal
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@../../../etc/passwd"

# Expected: 400 Bad Request - Filename sanitized
```

#### Test Case 2: Token Manipulation
```bash
# Attempt 1: Reuse blacklisted token
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/protected \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REVOKED_TOKEN"

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized - Token blacklisted

# Attempt 2: Expired token
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/protected \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPIRED_TOKEN"

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized - Token expired

# Attempt 3: Tampered token
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/protected \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TAMPERED_TOKEN"

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized - Invalid signature
```

#### Test Case 3: SQL Injection
```bash
# Attempt 1: Classic SQL injection
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/users?search=1' OR '1'='1"

# Expected: Parameterized queries prevent injection

# Attempt 2: Union-based injection
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/users?search=1' UNION SELECT * FROM passwords--"

# Expected: Input validation blocks

# Attempt 3: Blind SQL injection
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/users?search=1' AND SLEEP(5)--"

# Expected: No delay, query is parameterized
```

#### Test Case 4: XSS Attacks
```bash
# Attempt 1: Reflected XSS
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/comments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"<script>alert('XSS')</script>"}'

# Expected: Input sanitized, script tags removed

# Attempt 2: Stored XSS
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bio":"<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"}'

# Expected: HTML entities escaped

# Attempt 3: DOM-based XSS
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/search?q=<script>document.cookie</script>"

# Expected: Output encoding applied
```

#### Test Case 5: Authentication Bypass
```bash
# Attempt 1: No authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Attempt 2: Invalid token
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"

# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

# Attempt 3: Insufficient permissions
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden (USER role, needs ADMIN)
```

#### Test Case 6: Rate Limiting Bypass
```bash
# Attempt: Rapid requests
for i in {1..1000}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"wrong"}' &
done

# Expected: 429 Too Many Requests after threshold
```

#### Test Case 7: Data Encryption Validation
```bash
# Attempt 1: Direct database access
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT phone, address FROM \"Client\" LIMIT 1;"

# Expected: Encrypted data (starts with "encrypted:")

# Attempt 2: Tamper with encrypted data
# Manually modify encrypted field in database
# Then query via API

# Expected: Decryption fails, error returned

# Attempt 3: Missing encryption key
# Remove ENCRYPTION_KEY from environment
# Restart server and query

# Expected: Server fails to start or decryption fails
```

### 3. Automated Penetration Testing Tools
