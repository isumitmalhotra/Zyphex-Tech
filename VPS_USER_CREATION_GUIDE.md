## üöÄ Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Connect to Your VPS

```bash
ssh root@your-vps-ip
# Or use your SSH key if configured
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory

```bash
cd /var/www/zyphextech
# Or wherever your application is deployed
```

### Step 3: Ensure You're on the Latest Code

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 5: Upload the User Creation Script

**Option A: Use Git (Recommended)**
The script is already in your repository. Just pull the latest changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Option B: Manual Upload**
If you need to upload manually, create the file on VPS:
```bash
nano scripts/create-production-users.ts
# Paste the content and save with Ctrl+X, Y, Enter
```

### Step 6: Run the User Creation Script

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/create-production-users.ts
```

‚ú® User creation complete!

üìã Summary:
   Super Admins: 2
   Admins: 1
   Project Managers: 1
   Developers: 6
   Total: 10 users

üîê All users have the password: Haryana@272002
```

### Step 7: Verify User Creation

Run this command to check the users:
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/check-users.ts
```

Or check directly in database:
```bash
# If using PostgreSQL
psql -U your_db_user -d your_db_name -c "SELECT email, name, role FROM \"User\" ORDER BY role, name;"

# If using MySQL
mysql -u your_db_user -p your_db_name -e "SELECT email, name, role FROM User ORDER BY role, name;"
```

### Step 8: Test Login

1. Open your browser and go to: `https://yourdomain.com/login`
2. Try logging in with each account to verify they work

**Test with Super Admin:**
- Email: `sumitmalhotra@zyphextech.com`
- Password: `Haryana@272002`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'bcryptjs'"

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install bcryptjs @types/bcryptjs
```

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@prisma/client'"

**Solution:**
```bash
npm install @prisma/client
npx prisma generate
```

### Issue: Database Connection Error

**Solution:**
1. Check your `.env` file has correct DATABASE_URL
2. Verify database is running:
   ```bash
   # For PostgreSQL
   sudo systemctl status postgresql
   
   # For MySQL
   sudo systemctl status mysql
   ```

### Issue: "User already exists"

This is normal if running the script multiple times. The script uses `upsert` which updates existing users.

## üîê Security Notes

After initial setup, ask all users to change their passwords on first login.

### Set Up Password Policy (Future Enhancement)
Consider implementing:
- Password expiry
