## TypeScript Notes

⚠️ **Minor TypeScript Language Server Issue:**
The TypeScript language server may show `Property 'file' does not exist on PrismaClient` errors even though:
- ✅ Prisma migration was successfully applied
- ✅ Prisma Client was regenerated with `npx prisma generate`
- ✅ File model exists in schema.prisma
- ✅ Database table was created

**Resolution:** These errors will resolve automatically when:
1. TypeScript language server restarts (happens on VS Code reload)
2. Next build runs (generates fresh types)
3. Developer runs `npx prisma generate` manually

**Verification:** Run `npx prisma studio` to confirm File model exists in database.

---

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance
- **File Upload:** ~200-500ms for 5MB file
- **File Validation:** ~50-100ms per file
- **Malware Scan:** ~10-30ms for basic patterns
- **Database Query:** ~10-20ms (indexed queries)
- **Token Generation:** ~5-10ms (SHA-256)

### Rate Limits
- **Upload:** 10 files per 15 minutes per user
- **Download:** Unlimited (cached with proper headers)
- **Token TTL:** 60 minutes

### Storage Considerations
- **Current Limit:** 50MB per file (configurable)
- **Recommended Cleanup:** Implement cron job to delete expired files
- **Backup Strategy:** Include `uploads/` directory in backup plan

---

## Maintenance & Monitoring

### Logging Points
```typescript
✅ File upload success/failure
✅ Validation failures with details
✅ Malware scan results
✅ Authentication failures
✅ Rate limit violations
✅ File download requests
✅ Token verification failures
```

### Monitoring Recommendations
1. **Alert on:** Multiple malware detections from same user
2. **Track:** Upload volume by user/project
3. **Monitor:** Failed authentication attempts
4. **Review:** Rate limit violations weekly
5. **Audit:** File access patterns monthly

### Cleanup Script (Recommended)
```typescript
// Run daily via cron job
async function cleanupExpiredFiles() {
  const expiredFiles = await prisma.file.findMany({
    where: {
      createdAt: {
        lt: new Date(Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) // 30 days
      }
    }
  })
  
  for (const file of expiredFiles) {
    await fs.unlink(path.join(UPLOAD_DIR, file.filename))
    await prisma.file.delete({ where: { id: file.id } })
  }
}
```

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### ✅ Security Middleware
- Integrated with `secureApiRoute()` wrapper
- Uses existing rate limiting types ('file-upload')
- Follows established error response patterns

### ✅ Authentication
- Uses NextAuth `getServerSession(authOptions)`
- Respects existing role hierarchy (USER/ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN)
- Compatible with JWT token system

### ✅ Database
- Uses global Prisma client from `@/lib/prisma`
- Follows cascade delete patterns
- Maintains referential integrity with User/Project

### ✅ Logging
- Uses existing `console.error` patterns
- Compatible with Sentry error tracking (if enabled)
- Structured error responses for client consumption
