# CSP & WebSocket Fixes + Channel Member Management

## Date: October 11, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations

**Problem:**
- Font loading blocked from Perplexity CDN (`r2cdn.perplexity.ai`)
- Connection attempts blocked to external resources
- Multiple CSP `font-src` and `connect-src` violations in browser console

**Solution:**
Updated `middleware.ts` CSP directives:
```typescript
"font-src 'self' data: https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai",
"connect-src 'self' https://zyphextech.com https://www.zyphextech.com wss://zyphextech.com wss://www.zyphextech.com ws://localhost:* http://localhost:* https://r2cdn.perplexity.ai",
```

**Files Changed:**
- `middleware.ts` - Updated CSP policy headers

---

### 2. ✅ WebSocket Connection Errors

**Problem:**
- Socket.IO showing "Disconnected" status in dashboard
- Multiple WebSocket and XHR polling errors:
  - `Socket.io connection error: xhr poll error`
  - `Socket connection error: websocket error`
- Real-time messaging not working

**Root Cause:**
CSP policy was too restrictive and missing `www` subdomain in allowed connections.

**Solution:**
- Added `https://www.zyphextech.com` and `wss://www.zyphextech.com` to CSP connect-src
- Ensured both polling and WebSocket transports are allowed
- Fixed CORS configuration in `server.js` (already done in previous fix)

---

### 3. ✅ Channel Member Management Missing

**Problem:**
- No way to add specific users to specific channels
- Channels were all-or-nothing based on role permissions
- No UI to customize channel membership

**Solution:**

#### A. Created API Endpoints
**File:** `app/api/messaging/channels/[id]/members/route.ts`

- **POST** `/api/messaging/channels/[id]/members` - Add members to channel
  - Accepts `{ memberIds: string[] }`
  - Only admins or channel creators can add members
  - Creates system message announcing additions
  
- **DELETE** `/api/messaging/channels/[id]/members` - Remove members from channel
  - Accepts `{ memberIds: string[] }`
  - Only admins or channel creators can remove members
  - Creates system message announcing removals

#### B. Updated Frontend Hooks
**File:** `hooks/use-messaging.ts`

Added two new functions:
```typescript
addChannelMembers(channelId: string, memberIds: string[])
removeChannelMembers(channelId: string, memberIds: string[])
```

#### C. Enhanced Channel List UI
**File:** `components/messaging/ChannelList.tsx`

1. **New Dropdown Menu Option:**
   - Added "Manage Members" option in channel dropdown (visible to admins only)
   
2. **Member Management Dialog:**
   - Shows all users (Admins, PMs, Team Members, Clients)
   - Checkbox selection interface
   - Avatar and role display for each user
   - Shows current member status
   - Save/Cancel buttons

3. **Smart Member Updates:**
   - Calculates which members to add vs. remove
   - Sends only necessary API calls
   - Shows success/error toasts
   - Refreshes channel list after changes

#### D. Updated MessagingHub
**File:** `components/messaging/MessagingHub.tsx`

- Destructured new functions from `useMessaging()` hook
- Passed `onAddMembers` and `onRemoveMembers` props to both ChannelList instances

## How to Use Member Management

### For Admins/Channel Creators:
