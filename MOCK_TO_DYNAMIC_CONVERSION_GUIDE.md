## Conversion Patterns

### Pattern 1: Server Component with Prisma (Recommended)

```typescript
// app/super-admin/projects/active/page.tsx
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth"
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth"
import { redirect } from "next/navigation"

export default async function ActiveProjectsPage() {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
  
  if (!session || session.user.role !== 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
    redirect('/auth/login')
  }

  // Fetch real data from database
  const projects = await prisma.project.findMany({
    where: {
      status: 'IN_PROGRESS',
      deletedAt: null
    },
    include: {
      client: {
        select: { name: true, email: true, image: true }
      },
      manager: {
        select: { name: true, email: true, image: true }
      },
      tasks: {
        select: {
          id: true,
          status: true,
          priority: true
        }
      },
      team: {
        include: {
          user: {
            select: { name: true, image: true, email: true }
          }
        }
      },
      _count: {
        select: { tasks: true, documents: true }
      }
    },
    orderBy: { updatedAt: 'desc' }
  })

  // Calculate project statistics
  const projectStats = projects.map(project => ({
    ...project,
    progress: calculateProgress(project.tasks),
    tasksStats: {
      total: project._count.tasks,
      completed: project.tasks.filter(t => t.status === 'DONE').length,
      inProgress: project.tasks.filter(t => t.status === 'IN_PROGRESS').length,
      todo: project.tasks.filter(t => t.status === 'TODO').length
    }
  }))

  return <ActiveProjectsView projects={projectStats} />
}

function calculateProgress(tasks: any[]) {
  if (tasks.length === 0) return 0
  const completed = tasks.filter(t => t.status === 'DONE').length
  return Math.round((completed / tasks.length) * 100)
}
```

### Pattern 2: Client Component with API Route

```typescript
// app/api/super-admin/projects/active/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server"
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth"
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth"
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
  
  if (!session || session.user.role !== 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
  }

  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url)
  const status = searchParams.get('status') || 'IN_PROGRESS'
  const search = searchParams.get('search') || ''
  
  const projects = await prisma.project.findMany({
    where: {
      status,
      deletedAt: null,
      ...(search && {
        OR: [
          { name: { contains: search, mode: 'insensitive' }},
          { description: { contains: search, mode: 'insensitive' }}
        ]
      })
    },
    include: {
      client: true,
      manager: true,
      tasks: true,
      team: { include: { user: true }}
    },
    orderBy: { updatedAt: 'desc' }
  })
  
  return NextResponse.json({ projects })
}
```

```typescript
// app/super-admin/projects/active/page.tsx (Client Component)
"use client"

import { useState, useEffect } from "react"

export default function ActiveProjectsPage() {
  const [projects, setProjects] = useState([])
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchProjects() {
      try {
        const res = await fetch('/api/super-admin/projects/active')
        const data = await res.json()
        setProjects(data.projects)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch projects:', error)
      } finally {
        setLoading(false)
      }
    }
    
    fetchProjects()
  }, [])

  if (loading) return <LoadingSpinner />
  
  return <ActiveProjectsView projects={projects} />
}
```

### Pattern 3: Using SWR for Client-Side Fetching

```typescript
"use client"

import useSWR from 'swr'

const fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url).then(r => r.json())

export default function ActiveProjectsPage() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
    '/api/super-admin/projects/active',
    fetcher,
    {
      refreshInterval: 30000, // Refresh every 30 seconds
      revalidateOnFocus: true
    }
  )

  if (error) return <ErrorView />
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />
  
  return <ActiveProjectsView projects={data.projects} />
}
```

## Special Cases

### Analytics Pages
Analytics pages (traffic, conversions, performance) contain metrics that should come from:
1. **External Analytics Services** (Google Analytics, Plausible, Mixpanel)
2. **Application Performance Monitoring** (New Relic, Datadog, Sentry)
3. **Custom Tracking** (Build your own with database logging)

**Recommendation**: For MVP, keep mock data OR integrate with a simple analytics service like Plausible.

### CMS Content
Some pages already fetch from the CMS system. Just remove fallback mock data.

### Static Content
Some content (like testimonials, benefits, company values) might be better suited to stay in code or be managed through CMS rather than database tables.

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Project Management (Week 1)
- Super Admin: Active Projects, Completed Projects
- Project Manager: Tasks, Team Members
- API routes for projects and tasks

### Phase 2: Client & User Data (Week 2)
- Super Admin: Clients, Leads
- Project Manager: Time Tracking, Budget
- User: Documents, Tasks
- Team Member: Tasks, Time

### Phase 3: Analytics & Reports (Week 3)
- Project Manager: Analytics, Reports, Workload
- Super Admin: Content Management (cleanup)
- Decide on analytics solution

### Phase 4: Public Pages (Week 4)
- Careers page dynamic jobs
- Blog posts from CMS
- Polish and optimize

## Testing Checklist

After converting each page:
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Data displays correctly
- [ ] Search/filters work
- [ ] Pagination works (if applicable)
- [ ] Loading states display
- [ ] Error states handle gracefully
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (< 3s load)
- [ ] Empty states display when no data
- [ ] Authorization checks work
- [ ] Mobile responsive

## Performance Optimization

1. **Use Prisma select/include** to only fetch needed fields
2. **Add pagination** to large datasets
3. **Cache frequently accessed data** with Redis
4. **Use database indexes** on filtered fields
5. **Consider using** `unstable_cache` for static data
6. **Lazy load** heavy data on client components

## Example: Converting Super Admin Active Projects

I'll provide a complete example in the next message showing exactly how to convert one full page from mock to dynamic data.

**Total Pages to Convert**: ~34 pages  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks for full conversion  
**Immediate Impact**: Focus on project management pages first
