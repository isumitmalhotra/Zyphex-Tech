# Payment Pages - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

✅ **Payment Success Page** - `/invoices/[id]/payment-success`  
✅ **Payment Failure Page** - `/invoices/[id]/payment-failed`  
✅ **Receipt API** - `/api/invoices/[id]/receipt`  
✅ **Invoice Details API** - `/api/invoices/[id]`

---

## 🚀 Quick Usage

### 1. After Successful Payment

Redirect user to:
```
/invoices/{invoiceId}/payment-success
```

The page will:
- ✅ Show success animation
- ✅ Display payment details
- ✅ Allow receipt download
- ✅ Show confirmation email notice

### 2. After Failed Payment

Redirect user to:
```
/invoices/{invoiceId}/payment-failed?error_code=card_declined&payment_method=STRIPE
```

Query parameters:
- `error_code` - Machine-readable error (card_declined, insufficient_funds, etc.)
- `error_message` - Custom error message
- `payment_method` - Payment method attempted

The page will:
- ✅ Show error details
- ✅ Provide troubleshooting tips
- ✅ Allow retry
- ✅ Link to support

## 🔗 Stripe Integration Example

```typescript
// After payment_intent.succeeded webhook
const paymentIntent = event.data.object

// Update invoice payment
await prisma.payment.create({
  data: {
    invoiceId: paymentIntent.metadata.invoiceId,
    amount: paymentIntent.amount / 100,
    currency: paymentIntent.currency,
    paymentMethod: 'STRIPE',
    paymentReference: paymentIntent.id,
    status: 'COMPLETED',
    processedAt: new Date()
  }
})

// Redirect to success page
return {
  redirectUrl: `/invoices/${invoiceId}/payment-success`
}
```

```typescript
// After payment_intent.payment_failed webhook
const paymentIntent = event.data.object
const error = paymentIntent.last_payment_error

// Log failed payment
await prisma.payment.create({
  data: {
    invoiceId: paymentIntent.metadata.invoiceId,
    amount: paymentIntent.amount / 100,
    currency: paymentIntent.currency,
    paymentMethod: 'STRIPE',
