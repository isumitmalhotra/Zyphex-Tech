## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Browser Test
1. **Login as Super Admin**
   - Email: `admin@zyphextech.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

2. **Navigate to Messages**
   - Go to `/super-admin/messages`

3. **Test Features**
   - Click "People" tab → See all users grouped by role
   - Click any user → Opens DM
   - Type a message → Press Enter to send
   - Open in another browser → See real-time update
   - Try search bar → Search for messages/users

### Test Different Roles
```javascript
// In browser console - test API
await fetch('/api/messaging/users?grouped=true')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)

// Should show users based on logged-in user's role
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Messages not updating in real-time
**Solution:** Check Socket.io connection
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Socket status:', window.io)
// Should show connected socket
```

### Can't see certain users
**Solution:** This is expected! Role-based access control is working
- CLIENTs only see admins + team on their projects
- USERs only see admins
- Check role-based visibility matrix above

### TypeScript errors in IDE
**Solution:** TypeScript server cache issue
- Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window"
- Or wait 30 seconds for auto-refresh
- **Note:** Code is correct, just IDE caching

### "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution:** 
- All files exist and are correct
- Run: `npm run build` to verify no real errors
- TypeScript server will catch up
