# Quick Reference: What to Send Me

Once you complete Steps 1-6 from `GA4_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, send me this:

## Option 1: Send the Entire JSON File (EASIEST) âœ…

1. Open the JSON file you downloaded in Step 4
2. Copy **ALL** the contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste it here in chat

The file should look like this:
```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-name",
  "private_key_id": "abc123...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIE...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "ga4-analytics-reader@yourproject.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "123456789...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  ...
}
```

**ALSO PROVIDE:**
- Your **GA4 Property ID** (the number from Step 5)

---

## Option 2: Send Individual Values

If you prefer to extract manually, send me:

```
1. Service Account Email: 
   [paste the "client_email" value from JSON]

2. Private Key: 
   [paste the ENTIRE "private_key" value including \n characters]

3. GA4 Property ID: 
   [paste the number from Step 5]
```

## Example Message to Send

```
Here's my GA4 setup:

[Paste entire JSON file here]

GA4 Property ID: 123456789
```

That's it! Once I receive this, I'll configure your `.env` file and get real GA4 data flowing to your dashboard in 2 minutes! ðŸš€

## Why This is Safe

- âœ… Your credentials stay in your `.env` file (never committed to GitHub)
- âœ… Service account has read-only access (can't modify anything)
- âœ… Only used for analytics data (no access to other systems)
- âœ… You can revoke access anytime from Google Cloud Console
- âœ… Standard practice for server-to-server authentication

Ready when you are! ðŸŽ‰
