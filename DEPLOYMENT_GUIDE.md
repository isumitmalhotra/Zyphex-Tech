# üöÄ CI/CD Deployment System with Automatic Rollback

## Overview

This repository includes an advanced CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys to the VPS with built-in health checks and automatic rollback capabilities. If a deployment fails, the system automatically reverts to the last working version.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Automatic Deployment
- Triggers on every push to `main` branch
- Can also be manually triggered via GitHub Actions

### üîÑ Automatic Rollback
- If deployment fails, automatically rolls back to previous working version
- If health checks fail, restores the last working build
- Website remains live throughout the process

### üè• Health Checks
- Multiple retry attempts (5 retries with 10s intervals)
- Checks PM2 process status
- Validates HTTP health endpoint
- Ensures application is fully operational before completing

### üìß Notifications
- **Success**: Sends notification when deployment succeeds
- **Failure**: Sends alert when deployment fails with rollback confirmation
- Supports Discord and Slack webhooks

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features
- Backs up current build before deploying
- Stores current Git commit for rollback
- Validates build output before deployment
- Comprehensive error logging
- Timeout protection (30 minutes max)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Required GitHub Secrets

Navigate to your repository settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions, and add:

#### VPS Connection (Required)
```
VPS_HOST          - Your VPS IP address or domain
VPS_USER          - SSH username (usually 'root' or your username)
VPS_PORT          - SSH port (usually 22)
VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY - Your SSH private key
```

#### Notification Webhooks (Optional)
```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL - Discord webhook URL for notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL   - Slack webhook URL for notifications
```

### 2. Setting up SSH Key

Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy" -f ~/.ssh/github_deploy_key
```

Add the public key to your VPS:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/github_deploy_key.pub user@your-vps-ip
```

Add the private key content to GitHub Secrets as `VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/github_deploy_key
```

### 3. Setting up Discord Webhook (Optional)

1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to Integrations ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Click "New Webhook"
4. Copy the webhook URL
5. Add it to GitHub Secrets as `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`

### 4. Setting up Slack Webhook (Optional)

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Create a new app or select existing
3. Enable "Incoming Webhooks"
4. Add webhook to workspace
5. Copy the webhook URL
6. Add it to GitHub Secrets as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

## Deployment Workflows

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-with-rollback.yml`

This is the **recommended workflow** with automatic rollback:

```bash
# Simply push to main branch
git push origin main

# The workflow will:
# 1. Deploy new code
# 2. Run health checks
# 3. If successful: Complete deployment
# 4. If failed: Automatic rollback + notification
```

### Legacy Deployment

**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-vps.yml`

Basic deployment without automatic rollback (kept for reference).

## How It Works

### Successful Deployment Flow

```
1. Push to main branch
   ‚Üì
2. GitHub Actions triggered
   ‚Üì
3. Checkout code
   ‚Üì
4. Connect to VPS via SSH
   ‚Üì
5. Backup current build
   ‚Üì
6. Pull latest code
   ‚Üì
7. Install dependencies
   ‚Üì
8. Run Prisma generate & migrate
   ‚Üì
9. Build application
   ‚Üì
10. Restart PM2
   ‚Üì
11. Health check (5 retries, 10s interval)
   ‚Üì
12. ‚úÖ Success notification
   ‚Üì
13. Save PM2 state
```

### Failed Deployment Flow (Automatic Rollback)

```
1-10. Same as successful flow
   ‚Üì
11. Health check fails
   ‚Üì
12. Detect failure
   ‚Üì
13. Restore backed-up build
   ‚Üì
14. Reset Git to previous commit
   ‚Üì
15. Reinstall dependencies
   ‚Üì
16. Restart PM2 with old version
   ‚Üì
17. Verify rollback health check
   ‚Üì
18. üö® Failure notification (with rollback confirmation)
   ‚Üì
19. Website continues running on previous version
```

## Notification Examples

### Success Notification
```
üéâ Deployment Successful

Environment: Production VPS
Status: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
Commit: abc1234
Message: feat: Add new feature
Deployed by: john-doe
Time: 2024-10-24 10:30:00 UTC
Website: https://www.zyphextech.com

All health checks passed! üöÄ
```

### Failure Notification
```
üö® Deployment Failed & Rolled Back

Environment: Production VPS
Status: ‚ùå FAILED
Commit: xyz5678
Message: fix: Update configuration
Deployed by: jane-smith
Time: 2024-10-24 11:45:00 UTC

‚ö†Ô∏è The deployment failed and has been automatically rolled back to the last working version.

Action Required:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Review build/health check failures
3. Fix issues locally and test before pushing
4. Website remains live on previous version

Last working commit: Previous HEAD
Failed commit: xyz5678
```

## Manual Deployment

If you need to manually trigger deployment:

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Select "Deploy to VPS with Automatic Rollback"
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Select `main` branch
6. Click "Run workflow"

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails But No Rollback

Check PM2 logs on VPS:
```bash
pm2 logs zyphextech --lines 100
```

### SSH Connection Issues

Test SSH connection:
```bash
ssh -p YOUR_PORT YOUR_USER@YOUR_VPS_HOST
```

### Health Check Always Fails

Check if health endpoint is accessible:
```bash
# On VPS
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Build Failures

Check build logs in GitHub Actions or on VPS:
```bash
# On VPS
cd /var/www/zyphextech
cat build.log
```

## Monitoring

### View Deployment History

GitHub Actions:
- Navigate to Actions tab
- View all deployment runs
- Click on any run for detailed logs

### Check Current Deployment Status

On VPS:
```bash
cd /var/www/zyphextech
cat deployment.status
```

### PM2 Monitoring

```bash
pm2 status
pm2 monit
pm2 logs zyphextech
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test locally first**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check for errors before pushing**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   ```

3. **Use meaningful commit messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add budget tracking page"
   ```

4. **Monitor deployments**
   - Watch GitHub Actions logs
   - Check notifications
   - Verify website functionality

5. **If deployment fails**
   - Review the failure logs
   - Fix issues locally
   - Test thoroughly
   - Push again

nvm install 18.17.0
nvm use 18.17.0
nvm alias default 18.17.0
```
