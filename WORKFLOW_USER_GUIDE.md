## Introduction

### What is Workflow Automation?

Workflow automation allows you to create automated processes that respond to events in your system. When specific triggers occur (like a project being created or a task being completed), the workflow automatically executes a series of actions (like sending emails, posting to Slack, or creating notifications).

### Key Benefits

✅ **Save Time** - Automate repetitive tasks  
✅ **Reduce Errors** - Consistent execution every time  
✅ **Improve Communication** - Instant notifications  
✅ **Scale Operations** - Handle more work with same resources  
✅ **Track Performance** - Monitor execution and success rates  

### Who Can Use Workflows?

- **Administrators**: Create and manage all workflows
- **Super Admins**: Full system access
- **Team Members**: Benefit from automated notifications and processes

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before creating workflows, ensure you have:

1. **Admin Access**: ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN role

## Best Practices

### Design Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Names**
   - ✅ Good: "New Project Notification to Team"
   - ❌ Bad: "Workflow 1"

2. **Write Clear Descriptions**
   - Explain purpose
   - List key actions
   - Note any prerequisites

3. **Start with Templates**
   - Browse templates first
   - Customize instead of building from scratch
   - Learn from examples

4. **Test Before Enabling**
   - Use test dialog
   - Start disabled
   - Verify with real events
   - Monitor first executions

5. **Use Appropriate Priority**
   - Critical notifications: 8-10
   - Regular automation: 4-6
   - Low priority tasks: 1-3

6. **Set Reasonable Timeouts**
   - Quick actions: 60-120 seconds
   - API calls: 180-300 seconds
   - Long processes: 300-600 seconds

7. **Configure Retries Wisely**
   - Network calls: 3 retries
   - External APIs: 2-3 retries
   - Email: 3 retries
   - Critical actions: 5 retries

### Email Best Practices

1. **Use Clear Subject Lines**
   - Include entity name: `{{entity.data.name}}`
   - Add action context: "New Project Created"
   - Keep under 50 characters

2. **Format Email Body**
   - Use line breaks for readability
   - Include relevant details only
   - Add call-to-action link
   - Sign with team/company name

3. **Validate Recipients**
   - Use valid email fields
   - Check for null values
   - Consider fallback recipients

4. **Avoid Spam Triggers**
   - Don't overuse CAPS
   - Limit exclamation points
   - Include unsubscribe option (if applicable)

### Slack/Teams Best Practices

1. **Choose Right Channel**
   - Public channels for team updates
   - Private channels for sensitive info
   - Direct messages for individuals

2. **Format Messages**
   - Use markdown for emphasis: `*bold*`, `_italic_`
   - Add emojis for visibility: 🎉 ⚠️ ✅
   - Include links: `<url|text>`
   - Keep messages concise

3. **Avoid Noise**
   - Don't spam channels
   - Use threads for updates
   - Consider digest summaries

### Performance Best Practices

1. **Optimize Conditions**
   - Use specific conditions
   - Avoid complex nested logic
   - Test condition matching

2. **Minimize Actions**
   - Only include necessary actions
   - Combine when possible
   - Remove debug actions

3. **Use Wait Actions Sparingly**
   - Long waits block execution
   - Consider separate workflows
   - Use reasonable delays

4. **Monitor Success Rates**
   - Check statistics regularly
   - Investigate failures
   - Optimize failing workflows

### Security Best Practices

1. **Protect Sensitive Data**
   - Don't hardcode secrets
   - Use environment variables
   - Limit access to workflows

2. **Validate Webhook Sources**
   - Use webhook signatures
   - Verify sender identity
   - Rate limit webhooks

3. **Review Permissions**
   - Only admins create workflows
   - Audit workflow changes
   - Monitor execution logs

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Who can create workflows?**
A: Only users with ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN roles can create, edit, and delete workflows.

**Q: How many workflows can I create?**
A: There's no hard limit. However, consider performance when running many workflows simultaneously.

**Q: Can workflows trigger other workflows?**
A: Yes, use the TRIGGER_WORKFLOW action to chain workflows together.

**Q: Are workflows executed immediately?**
A: Most triggers execute within seconds. Schedule triggers run at specified times. Execution may be queued during high load.

**Q: Can I export workflows?**
A: Currently, workflows are stored in the database. Manual export via API is possible but not built into the UI.

### Template Questions

**Q: Can I save my workflow as a template?**
A: This feature is not currently available but is planned for future releases.

**Q: Can I share templates with other organizations?**
A: No, the current template system is built-in and cannot be shared between organizations.

**Q: How do I add new templates?**
A: Contact your system administrator. Templates must be added to the codebase.

### Execution Questions

**Q: How long are execution logs kept?**
A: Execution logs are kept indefinitely unless manually deleted. Older logs may be archived based on system settings.

**Q: Can I retry a failed execution?**
A: Automatic retries happen based on workflow settings. Manual retry is not currently available but planned.

**Q: What happens if an action fails?**
A: The workflow retries the action (based on retry settings). If all retries fail, the workflow execution fails.

**Q: Can I pause a running workflow?**
A: No, workflows cannot be paused mid-execution. You can disable the workflow to stop processing new triggers.

### Configuration Questions

**Q: What's the maximum timeout?**
A: The system allows up to 3600 seconds (1 hour), but 300 seconds (5 minutes) is recommended for most workflows.

**Q: How many actions can a workflow have?**
A: There's no hard limit, but 10-15 actions is recommended for performance.

**Q: Can I use external APIs in workflows?**
A: Yes, use the WEBHOOK action to call any external API.

**Q: How do I use variables in templates?**
A: Use double curly braces: `{{entity.data.fieldName}}`. Available fields depend on the trigger type.

### Performance Questions

**Q: Why is my workflow slow?**
A: Check for: too many actions, external API delays, large wait times, or complex conditions.

**Q: What's a good success rate?**
A: Above 95% is excellent, 80-95% is good, below 80% needs investigation.

**Q: How often do workflows run?**
A: Event-based workflows run when triggered. Scheduled workflows run at specified times.

**Q: Can workflows run in parallel?**
A: Yes, multiple workflow executions can run simultaneously based on system resources.
